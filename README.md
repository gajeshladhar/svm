# svm
This is the implementation of Support Vector Machine (Classification) with kernel and without kernel both. it is purely written in C++ and has been optimized a lot.
currently i have trained it on Social_Ads Dataset on which sklearn's python implementation got only 82% Accuracy but our implementation got 95.3% Accuracy.
You can use grid search to find best params manually.
